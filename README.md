### Day 1: Introduction to Agentic AI and Automation

**Live Session Timing (9:30 - 10:30 PST / ~9:30 - 10:30 PM PKT/IST)**  

1. **Welcome and Course Overview**   
   - This is a complete zero-to-hero program – no prior knowledge needed. We'll go from basics to building production-level autonomous AI agents that can think, plan, and act on their own.  
   - We'll cover 100+ days live, daily at this time, with theory, live coding, projects, and real-world examples relevant to our region (like automating remittances, cricket score trackers, or e-commerce bots for local markets).  
   - Everything free: Code on GitHub, datasets from Kaggle/Hugging Face, no paid tools.  
   - Goal: By the end, you'll build and deploy agentic systems that can automate jobs, boost freelancing income, or start your own AI ventures."

2. **What is Agentic AI?**  
   - Simple definition: "Agentic AI is the next level beyond ChatGPT-style chatbots. These are autonomous AI 'agents' that don't just answer questions – they take goals, break them into steps, use tools (like web search, databases, APIs), reason, reflect on mistakes, and complete complex tasks independently."  
   - Difference from regular AI:  
     | Type | Example | Limitation |  
     |------|---------|------------|  
     | Generative AI (like GPT) | Answers questions | Passive – waits for prompts |  
     | Agentic AI | Books a flight, researches jobs, automates shopping | Active – plans and executes multi-step tasks |  
   - Why now in 2026?:  
     - Agentic AI is exploding: Companies like Walmart use it for inventory, Capital One for customer service, MakeMyTrip for trip planning 
     - Real examples: AI agents handling payments (PayPal/Mastercard), browser agents automating web tasks, multi-agent teams for business workflows.  
     - In our region: Potential for automating Upwork freelancing bids, tracking Daraz/Amazon prices, or building chat agents.

3. **What is Automation in This Context?**  
   - "Automation here means building workflows where AI agents handle repetitive tasks: scraping data, sending emails, analyzing reports – all without constant human input."  
   - Low-code vs. code: We'll start with code for full control, later add n8n for visual workflows.

4. **Real-World Example**   
     - An agent that tracks cricket scores and sends WhatsApp alerts.  
     - Automates job applications on Rozee.pk or LinkedIn.  
     - Price comparator for local e-commerce during Eid sales.  
   - Career impact: High demand for agentic AI skills.

5. **Course Roadmap Quick Peek**  
   - Module 1 (Days 1-5): Intro & Setup  
   - Module 2 (Days 6-20): Python Mastery  
   - ... up to Deployment & Capstones (Day 100+).  
   - Daily: Live coding + homework. Weekly projects.

6. **Your First "Agent" Preview**  
   - Install Python (if not done): Go to python.org, download latest (3.12+).  
   - Open terminal/VS Code.  
   - Run a simple script:  
     ```python
     print("Hello from your future AI Agent!")
     name = input("What's your goal today? ")
     print(f"I'm an agent helping with: {name}. In 100 days, I'll automate it!")
     ```  
   - This is rule-based – we'll evolve to LLM-powered agents using LangChain.

7. **We already have setuped**  
   - Download:  
     - Python (python.org)  
     - VS Code (code.visualstudio.com) – free editor.  
     - Git (git-scm.com) – for version control.  
   - Create free GitHub account if not have.  
   - Repo: We'll use `Agentic-AI-Automation-Mastery` (create/fork it – I'll share link in description).

8. **Ethics Quick Note**  
   - "We'll always focus on ethical AI: No harmful scraping, respect privacy, build for good (e.g., education/remittance tools)."

#### Homework for Day 1
