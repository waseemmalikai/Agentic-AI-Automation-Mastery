##  Zero to Hero in Agentic AI and Automation
The goal is to provide a complete, self-contained journey from absolute zero (no prior knowledge assumed) to hero/mastery level, where learners can build production-grade agentic AI systems and automation workflows without needing any other courses. No gaps—every concept will be broken down with theory, real-world examples (like automating remittances, cricket analytics, or e-commerce for local festivals), code demos, exercises, debugging tips, best practices, and advanced extensions.

To achieve depth:
- **Daily Structure**: Each 1-hour live session = 40-45 minutes of teaching (theory + live coding), 10-15 minutes Q&A/interaction. End with homework (e.g., code challenges on GitHub).
- **Depth per Module**: Expand modules into sub-modules/days with progressive layers: Basics → Intermediate → Advanced → Mastery (real-world projects, optimizations, edge cases).
- **Total Days**: Aimed at 100+ days. I've allocated ~10 days per module on average, with flexibility to extend (e.g., if a topic needs more time based on viewer feedback).
- **Resources**: All free—GitHub repo for code/notebooks, Jupyter/Colab for interactivity, free datasets (Kaggle, Hugging Face), and tools like VS Code. Include daily recaps, cheat sheets, and community Discord for discussions.
- **Assessment & Mastery**: Daily quizzes (via YouTube polls or Google Forms), weekly assignments, and capstone projects. At mastery level, cover scaling, troubleshooting, and contributing to open-source.
